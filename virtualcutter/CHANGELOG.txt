CHANGELOG $Id: CHANGELOG.txt 270 2011-12-02 09:10:32Z thijs $

1.0-beta2
- Removed functionality where object tag was hidden during loading, because not
  all flash players (IE) correctly communicate when they're finished.
- Height calculation is now done fully based on width and aspect ratio with
  fallback to defaultAspectRatio.

1.0-beta1
- Changed button ratio to make them less wide to allow for a wider progress bar.
- Removed the resources directory.
- Removed index.php and made it into a static example.html, only issue there is
  that remote linking to an mp4 file for flash requires a crossdomain.xml on
  the hosting server, which might not be available or doesn't allow all domains
  from http://video-js.zencoder.com/
- Changed default aspect ratio to 16:9.
- Added LICENSE, README and CHANGELOG files.
